      <h5>Personal Life</h5>
      <p>
        Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (née Monni)—a six-time
        Finnish national karate champion—whom he first met in late 1993. Linus
        was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and
        instructed the course attendees to send him an e-mail as a test, to
        which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date.Tove and Linus
        were later married and have three daughters, two of whom were born in
        the United States.The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts their
        dates of birth (written in hexadecimal) as magic values. Torvalds has
        described himself as "completely a-religious—atheist", adding that "I
        find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation
        of nature. I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the
        excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation
        is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow,
        it's incredible that something like this could have happened in the
        first place.'" He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a
        personal issue, in the United States it has become very politicized.
        When discussing the issue of church and state separation, Torvalds also
        said, "Yeah, it's kind of ironic that in many European countries, there
        is actually a kind of legal binding between the state and the state
        religion." In a story about the March LinuxWorld Conference titled
        "Linus the Liberator", Torvalds is quoted as saying "There are like two
        golden rules in life. One is 'Do unto others as you would want them to
        do unto you.' For some reason, people associate this with Christianity.
        I'm not a Christian. I'm agnostic. The other rule is 'Be proud of what
        you do.'" In 2010, Torvalds became a United States citizen and
        registered to vote in the United States. He is unaffiliated with any
        U.S. political party, saying, "I have way too much personal pride to
        want to be associated with any of them, quite frankly." Linus developed
        an interest in scuba diving in the early 2000s and went on to achieve
        numerous certifications, which later led to him creating the Subsurface
        project.
